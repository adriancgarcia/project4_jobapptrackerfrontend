## Description

When applying to jobs we submit multiple applications, sometimes in the hundreds. Keeping track of all the companies and positions you've applied to can get confusing and overwhelming. My job application tracker can help keep you organized by keeping a log of all the necessary information for each job you've applied to. This will help you when you get the call from a company to do your first interview.
